# Vehicle-Sales-Forecasting

This project involved consumer spending data, vehicle sales, and vehicle miles traveled data ranging from the years 1976 to 2022. The data was collected from the website (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/).  The kind of applications I sought to implement was to forecast vehicle total sales based off data about vehicle miles traveled and consumer spending along with providing a combination of different visualizations.
